                    <p><br>COVID-19 has had effects on health (mental, physical, and emotional), societies and socialisation, and economies across the globe. One of the greatest observed implications of the pandemic and government/public response has been on the environment.

These cities are international cities across the world which have had significant activity during the COVID-19 pandemic - either in their outbreaks or their response strategies.</p>
